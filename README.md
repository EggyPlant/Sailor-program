# Sailor-program
Beginner experiement project written in Ruby

Hello, take a look at this fun little program! Written in Ruby, it's a program that sings the song "99 Bottles of beer" and it progresses through the entire song from bottle 99 to 0. The only trouble is that with every bottle that goes down, the singer becomes more inebriated and slurs the words to the song (uh oh!). 

As a beginner project my code is fairly unsophisticated so I invite all other beginning programmers looking to contribute for open source projects; whether its for the first time or you're a pro! Feel free to make changes to the code but I ask that you avoid making changes to the story part. ty!
